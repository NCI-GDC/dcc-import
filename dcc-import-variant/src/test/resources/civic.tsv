JAK2	3717	V617F	Lymphoid Leukemia	10747		Diagnostic	Supports	B	Negative	JAK2 V617F is not associated with lymphoid leukemia (B-lineage ALL, T-ALL or CLL).	16081687	Levine et al., 2005, Blood	4	accepted	1	64	28	9	5073770	5073770	G	T	ENST00000381652.3					75	GRCh37	JAK2 V617F is a highly recurrent mutation in myeloproliferative diseases. It is found in around 98% of patients with polycythemia vera, and just over half of the patients with essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis. While less associated with cancer, when it is seen, it is more likely to be in myeloid leukemias than lymphoid leukemias. The V617F mutation is an activating mutation, resulting in increased kinase activity. The mutation seems to be restricted to hematologic malignancies. Treatment of JAK mutant diseases with ruxolitinib has seen some clinical success.

PDGFRA	5156	D842V	Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor	9253		Diagnostic	Supports	B	Negative	GIST tumors harboring PDGFRA D842V mutation are more likely to be benign than malignant.	15146165	Lasota et al., 2004, Lab. Invest.	3	accepted	2	99	38	4	55152093	55152093	A	T	ENST00000257290.5					75	GRCh37	PDGFRA D842 mutations are characterized broadly as imatinib resistance mutations. This is most well characterized in gastrointestinal stromal tumors, but other cell lines containing these mutations have been shown to be resistant as well. Exogenous expression of the A842V mutation resulted in constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGFRA in the absence of ligand in 293T cells and cytokine-independent proliferation of the IL-3-dependent Ba/F3 cell line, both evidence that this is an activating mutation. In imatinib resistant cell lines, a number of other therapeutics have demonstrated efficacy. These include; crenolanib, sirolimus, and midostaurin (PKC412).

DNMT3A	1788	R882	Acute Myeloid Leukemia	9119		Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	DNMT3A R882 mutations occur most often in de novo AML patients with intermediate risk cytogenetics (39/194 intermediate risk patients vs 0/89 low and high risk).	22081665	LaRochelle et al., 2011, Oncotarget	2	accepted	3	32	18	2	25457241	25457243			ENST00000264709.3					75	GRCh37	DNMT3A R882 mutations are associated with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) with R882H as the most common form. Mutations in DNMT3A have largely been associated with poorer prognosis, however this is not consistent across all studies. This may be a result of patient age or combining R882 and non-R882 mutations during analysis as studies have indicated independent mechanisms of action and differential prognostic implications for these mutation types. One study that independently analyzed R882 and non-R882 mutations showed R882 mutations were associated with poorer prognosis than patients with wildtype and non-R882 mutations, but only in older patients with AML.

KRAS	3845	G12	Acute Leukemia	12603		Diagnostic	Supports	B	Positive	Children with early age leukaemia who had second hand smoke exposure are more likely to harbor KRAS mutation.	24571676	Andrade et al., 2014, BMC Cancer	3	accepted	8	76	30	12	25398284	25398285			ENST00000256078.4					75	GRCh37	While the KRAS G12 region is a widely studied recurrent region in cancer, its impact on clinical action is still debated. Often associated with tumors that are wild-type for other drivers (EGFR and ALK specifically), the prognosis for patients with this mutation seems to be worse than the KRAS wild-type cohort in patients with colorectal and pancreatic cancer, however this hypothesis is in need of further validation. This mutation, along with the mutations affecting the neighboring G13 position, may result in a less responsive tumor when treated with first-generation TKI's like gefitinib. However, cetuximab treatment was shown to extend survival in a cohort of colorectal patients.

Two melanoma patients, each harboring mutations at this locus (Q61L and Q61R), responded to treatment with the akylating agent temozolomide. However, in colorectal cancer patients, mutations at this locus have been shown to confer resistance to cetuximab. The prognostic impact of mutations at this locus is currently under study.
