##Mapping of ClinVar's VariationID (used to build the URL on the web site) and the AlleleIDs assigned to each variant.
##When the canonical identifier is generated from NCBI's allele registry, those values will be added to this report.
##Explanation of the columns in this report
#VariationID:              the identifier assigned by ClinVar and used to build the URL, namely https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/VariationID
#Type:                     Types of VariationID include Variant (simple variant), Haplotype, CompoundHeterozygote, Complex, Phase unknown, Distinct chromosomes
#AlleleID:                 the integer identifier assigned by ClinVar to each simple allele
#Interpreted:              _yes_ indicates an intepretation was submitted about the VariationID specifically, _no_ indicates that information about the VariationID was submitted as a component of a different record.
